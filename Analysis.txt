Task0
------
Get item for Python list is O(1) and all other the statements happens in constant time so the 
the runtime for Task0 is O(1).

Task1
-----
Task1 contains three major instructions that affects the runtime of the task, which are
2 list comprehension and one union operation.
The Order for one list comprehension is 0(n) resulting in 0(2n). since there is two list comprehensions
but constant are ignore so the Order for Task1 is 0(n)

Task2
----
There is only one loop for in this task. Therefore is 0(n)

Task3
-----
Task3 has 3 single loops and one sorting, the Order can be considered as 0(3n+nlogn) , 
Taking only the highest term, the Order for task3 becomes 0(nlogn)

Task4
-----

Task4 has 2 single loops and one sorting statement, 
The runtime can be considered as 0(n+n+nlogn) .ie 0(2n+nlogn)
The highest term which is 'nlogn' is considered. Therefore the Order is 0(nlogn)
