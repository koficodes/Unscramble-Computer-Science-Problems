Task0
------
Get item for Python list is O(1) and all other the statements happens in constant time so the 
the runtime for Task0 is O(1).

Task1
-----
Task1 contains three major instructions that affects the runtime of the task, which are
2 list comprehension and one union operation.
The Order for one list comprehension is 0(n) resulting in 0(2n). since there is two list comprehensions
but constant are ignore so the Order for Task1 is 0(n)

Task2
----
The critical part for Task2 is the nested for loops. Also the outer loop decreases by one
for each iteration. Therefore the Order might be considered as 0(n*(n-1)) but again constants
are ignored since they have no major impact. Therefore the Order for Task2 is 0(n^2)

Task3
-----
Task3 has 3 single loops and the Order can be considered as 0(3n) , ingoreing the constant
the Order for task3 becomes 0(n)

Task4
-----

Task4 has 2 single loops , Therefore the Order is 0(n)
